Galaxy CMD Creator

A photometry pipeline for galaxies and wide fields.

Interactive user input (galaxy name, distance, extinction parameters, FITS files).

Background subtraction and source detection in B and V bands.

FWHM measurement and adaptive aperture photometry.

Cross–matching of B and V detections.

Extraction of reference stars from the APASS catalog via Vizier.

Zero–point calibration of magnitudes using N reference stars.

Removal of catalog stars from the calibrated dataset to isolate field sources.

Outputs full and cleaned photometry catalogs with calibrated B and V magnitudes.

Generates CMDs for both full and cleaned catalogs, plus V–band images with detected sources marked.
